# IoT Parking Simulator
This project is a Python-based simulation of a car parking system where cars enter and exit the parking lot every minute. The simulation was connected to the University Thingsboard MQTT server to generate data for visualization purposes. The data was used to create a custom heatmap on Thingsboard, highlighting the most frequented parking spots, including specific interest spots like mall entrance points and areas affected by rush hours.

# Visualization
- The data generated by the simulation was used to create a heatmap on Thingsboard.

- The heatmap highlighted the parking spots with the highest frequency of cars.
- Drivers tend to occupy spaces as close to the entrance as possible.
- Provided insights into peak usage times and popular parking areas (ex. for cleaning purposes).
- Visualises data and parking layout with slots taken in the command line.

# Installation and Setup Instructions
Clone this repository. This requires `Python between 3.7 and 3.11` (preferred `Python 3.10`)

### Installation:
Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setup:
You can change constants at the beginning of the code to change the behaviour of the simulation.
If you wish to send the data to MQTT broker (ex. Thingsboard), you need to configure the variables according to your broker's configuration.

This simulation works 'as is' locally, without any need to send data externally.

### Run:
`python main.py`
